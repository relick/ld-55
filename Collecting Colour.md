The Golden Flower
An old fable

Once, grew a golden plant at the top of a great mountain. This plant attracted bugs and bees from far away, as the gentle slopes of the mountain spread the sweet smell of the plant wide. But no bee nor bug could make it to the plant, as the mountain was too tall, and insect lives are short.

"I will make it to the Golden Flower" proclaimed a brave rainbow-coloured bug, and embarked on her one-way pilgrimage just as many of her relatives had done.
"I will even come back." she remarked confidently. An old bee had told her of a way to live a smidge longer.

The old bee had said that on the journey, she must stop each night and tear off her wings. The magic on the trail would make them grow back by the morning, and she would live a day longer too.
The first night, the brave bug truly needed to be brave. She found a tree to rub against, and ripped her wings into tatters. It was unspeakably painful, and left her broken and ugly. As she attempted to sleep, she wondered whether the old bee had even told the truth, and if he hadn't, why she felt she had to believe him. Thinking back, she also wondered why the old bee had no black stripes.

The next day, the brave bug's wings were back, as if newly emerged from the cocoon. The world looked different, but she couldn't quite tell. "The old bee was right. This will be easy!"

The brave bug repeated this every night. On the fourth day, she passed a pond, and glanced at herself in its reflection. "Something must be wrong with my eyes. Maybe it's the magic of the trail, but I can only count three of my rainbow."

The night before the final day, the brave bug could see the golden plant up ahead. It was a day away, within reach, but not today. The moon made its gold sparkle, and it was truly as beautiful as all the bugs and bees had told her about as she grew.

But in the morning, its glitter was gone. Its flowers remained, and smelled as sweat as ever, but it glistened only a pure white dotted with deep blacks, as did all the mountain, and the long path back was monochrome too. A small puddle fed the previously golden plant with nutrients, and in the mirror the brave bug saw only a black bug, with no rainbow left.
