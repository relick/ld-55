Ant on a Leaf
by Philosoworx: "We do the thinking!"

Welcome to the latest edition of "Thinking Metaphorically". Consider an ant on a leaf. For an ant, a leaf is the greatest meal. It provides sustenance for a lifetime. If an ant wanted, it could live by a leaf and enjoy the rest of its days. Instead, it congregates with other ants. Together they cut the leaf from its stem, and carry it to a mound where they rip it apart to share amongst themselves.


The reward for the ant making this sacrifice is only more work to do, and a smaller portion of food. Imagining that the ant is contemplating its actions before taking them, is the ant under the belief that it must work together or be left to die? Perhaps it is instead acting for a moral good, ensuring that everyone is fed rather than itself engorged. It also may not believe it to be a sacrifice at all, as it is only possibility it gives up rather than certainty, and besides, who said the leaf belonged to the ant anyway?Humans anthropomorphise animal behaviour, but only at arms length.


We assume there must be some rules, but that those rules are different from ours. Such as, if a predator finds a prey, that it is okay for the predator to kill the prey. Trying to think of humans as predators and other creatures as prey, and giving us the moral right to kill any creature that comes our way, however, seems barbaric. Yet this is what we do anyway, raising prey, killing prey, and rarely giving a second thought.
Thinking back to our ant on the leaf, we assume that animals cannot have land rights, but that they're also allowed to use land however they wish -


up to a point - most human-owned land is considered off limits, but not for all animals. An ant tends to be left alone. Is this to say that ants have ownership over the leaves they come across, or is it to say that they are beyond the petty squabbles of private land in the first place? This could be why the ant shares the leaf - it knows the leaf neither belongs to it, nor belongs to anyone. To keep it for itself would be anathema to how the world truly is: a world of life, which simply exists, and belongs to no-one.
