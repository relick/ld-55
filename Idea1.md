Theme: Summoning

This is my indulgent idea, the one that even though I know it's not that great, I still kinda wanna make.

It takes place in a house and its surrounding plot of land. This land is itself engulfed by the land of a wealthy landowner, though this is not so much a trouble to living it is toward freedom.
The core gameplay revolves around trying to reach the summoning circle between your house and the landowner's house, through solving small adventure game/escape room puzzles.
The summoning circle is able to summon colour back into the world, but because it's on private land, none shall trespass

Asset Plan:
// Character movement
// Shaders (black and white, then return to colour by parameter)
// Terrain (does unity have heightmap stuff? I think it does?)

Models:
// Circle model
// Fences
House model
Billboard with sniper
Cameras and trip wires?

Features:
Interaction (pick up, combine, put down, use)
Text system
Game states and progression

Design plan:
There needn't be a linearity to this nor an obvious sequence of events. Trying to go to the circle by itself makes you die in an unknown way (police siren?). Learning about the sniper makes the billboard with the sniper appear, killing you by sniper if you go to the circle, and crafting a weapon allows you to take him out, which is a solution
Reading the books allows you to understand that the barriers we put up are not really real, and death no longer comes.
Or the practical answer, you can discover the cameras and the trip wires, and either avoid them, or craft a device to disarm them

While I get started with the assets and the coding, I can have a think about any puzzles, maybe just doing above is still a shit ton to aim for in just 2 days, I've not even mentioned music too, so adding more puzzles might be the worst idea
