How the Earth Appeared
Corporal E. Sluppet

A little after my return from the Undigo Line, in the midst of the War with the East, we received the broadcast of pictures of the Earth through our television sets.
I write this journal now as a matter of thought-sorting. First my mind was empty, in awe perhaps, but also confused at what I was looking at.
My confusion was quickly replaced by a sort of shock, that only an image beyond imagination could produce.


I looked at the world map on the wall and noted the country lines, then back at the television to try to find them.
It was fruitless, of course, there are no countries when viewed from space. I wondered about the Undigo Line, the wall of defences I'd been shoring up and bunkered in for six and a half months, and realised you simply could not see it in those pictures. It was too small and insignificant, and maybe I felt small myself as I was small even compared to the Undigo Line.


My thinking wandered to God, and I felt reinforced that something as beautiful as the Earth as I was seeing could only have been crafted by a great being, but simultaneously lost, wondering why God who could create such worlds would worry with the triflings of humans as described in the Bible.
Indeed, despite watching images from space, and deeply immersed, I started to feel more on the ground than I ever have been.
That Earth was beneath my feet, after all, not some foreign entity, and all my zest for the War with the East washed away in that moment.
